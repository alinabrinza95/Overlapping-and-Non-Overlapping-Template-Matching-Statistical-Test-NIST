Overlapping and Non-Overlapping Template Matching Statistical Test NIST SP800-22
Both non-overlapping.py and overlapping.py were writen using Python v.2.
non-overlapping.py => 
  The number of independent blocks is 90.
  The length of the target string was set to 10 as NIST recommended.
 overlapping.py =>
  The number of independent blocks is 968.
  The length of each independent block is 1032.
  The degree of freedom is 5.
  The length of the Epsilon string is pow(10,6)
  The target string is generate din the function create_target_regex.
  When running the script, the user is asked to enter the regex expression for entering the regex of the target_string.
  That regex is written before "STEP 1"
  Enter that regex and then see if the sequence is considered to be random or not.
